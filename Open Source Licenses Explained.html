           <h1> What is an Open source Licenses?</h1>
              <p>The simplest explanation is that open source licenses are legal and binding contracts between the author and the user of a software component, declaring that the software can be used in commercial applications under specified conditions. The license is what turns code into an open source component. Without an open source license, the software component is unusable by others, even if it has been publicly posted on GitHub.</p>
              <p>Each open source license states what users are permitted do with the software components, their obligations, and what they cannot do as per the terms and conditions. This might sound pretty straight forward, but there are over 200 open source licenses out there so good luck keeping them all organized. Varying in complexity and requirements, it is up to organizations to choose which licenses are most compatible with their policies to ensure that they remain compliant.</p>

      <h1>Microsoft Public Licenses (Ms-PL)</h1>
       <p>The Microsoft Public License is a free and open source software license released by Microsoft, which wrote it for its projects that were released as open source.</small>
       <p>You are free to reproduce and distribute original or derivative works of any software licensed under the Ms-PL license. However, you may not use any contributors' name, logo, or trademarks when you do so. The Ms-PL protects the authors by explicitly not offering any express warranties or guarantees for using your code, so the author is not liable if the code doesn’t work well in some cases.</p>
       <p>When you distribute software (or its portion) under the Ms-PL, you’re not required to distribute its source code. You may do so if you want to, but you’re not obliged. However, you’re required to retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are originally present in the software.</p>
       <p>Additionally, if you distribute any portion of the software in its source code form, you may do so only under the Ms-PL by including a complete copy of this license with your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in its compiled or object code form, you may only do so under any other license that complies with the Ms-PL.</p>
       <p>It is important to note that the Ms-PL terms and conditions document is very short, concise and written in a very coherent language. Microsoft wanted to be very clear and direct with the open source community, which also helps the adoption rate (as we know from the BSD license).</p>
